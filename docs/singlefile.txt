here's some comments from merlyn

The original place where decwar was placed was 5,30 which was the GAM:
ersatz device, CIS was using [1,27] was the multiplayer decwar directory.
Everyone would be handed off from their original hosts to that HOST and logged onto that directory.
The CIS source is Always referencing it.

current pic is that the three files below could be direct from the utexas tape that got sent to compuserve. notice they don't mention the many 'newer / later / compuserve' fortran files. so...

at utexas the build was done in [10,30,decwar] and then deployed to gam: which was a 'logical device name' assigned to [5,30].

at compuserve, the build was deployed to [1,27]. not clear yet where they did there build, hopefully doesn't really matter too much?


# 'important' file decwar.imp

The following files are included on the DECWAR source distribution tape:

DECWAR.IMP	This file.

Files to be installed on GAM:
DECWAR.EXE	DECWAR game.  Protected for EXECUTE access.
DECWAR.HLP	Help for DECWAR.  Source for on line help system.
Protected for READ access.
DECWAR.NWS	News file (recent developments).  Protected for READ access.
DECWAR.GRP	Gripe file.  Initially empty, added to by the DECWAR GRIPE
command.  Must be protected to allow write access.

Files from which the GAM: files are derived:

HIGH.FOR	Used to force common block into high segment.
LOW.FOR	Used to force common block into low segment.
DECWAR.FOR	FORTRAN source.
WARMAC.MAC	MACRO source.
MSG.MAC	Output text source (to force text into the high segment,
and to get rid of the annoying trailing blanks FORTRAN
generates for literals).
SETUP.FOR	Once only code, deleted from core after initialization.
SETMSG.MAC	Equivalent to MSG.MAC for SETUP text strings.
DECWAR.RNH	Help file source.

# tape drive fair warning!

to read from tape, the following has to come first in simh script. it may not be obvious but this actually enables the tape drive for use! without it, no tape read.

expect "\r\n." send "r opr\r"; continue
expect "OPR>" send "\r"; continue
expect "OPR>" send "\r"; continue
expect "OPR>" send "set tape mta0 unavailable\r"; continue
expect "Enter text and terminate with ^Z" send "installing software\r\32"; continue
expect "OPR>" send "\r"; continue
expect "OPR>" send "exit\r"; continue
expect "\r\n." send "k/f\r"; continue

# write decwar file with back10

here's our initial automation for writing decwar.tap

rm -rf ./decwar-files
mkdir ./decwar-files
cp ~/decwar/utexas/*.* ./decwar-files
cp ~/decwar/compuserve/*.* ./decwar-files
cp ~/decwar/scripts/COM1.CMD ./decwar-files
cp ~/decwar/scripts/COM2.CMD ./decwar-files
cp ~/decwar/scripts/CAN1.CMD ./decwar-files
./back10 -cf ./decwar.tap ./decwar-files/*
./back10 -lf ./decwar.tap

# read decwar tap file

assuming opr has prepped the tape drive as noted first thing above in 'tape drive fair warning', following will make the files we wrote to the tap file appear in current users sfd decwar. we usually want to be user dist [10,7] for this, so sfd [10,7,decwar]

expect "\r\n." send "r backup\r"; at %TAP%0 -r decwar.tap;  continue
expect "\r\n/" send "tape mta0:\r"; continue
expect "\r\n/" send "rewind\r"; continue
expect "\r\n/" send "inter\r"; continue
expect "\r\n/" send "files\r"; continue
expect "\r\n/" send "rest [,,decwar]*.*=*.*\r"; continue
expect "\r\n/" send "exit\r"; continue

# build and install decwar

we're user dist [10,7] - change directory into [10,7,decwar]

expect "\r\n." send "r setsrc\r"; continue
expect "\r\n*" send "cp [10,7,decwar]\r"; continue
expect "\r\n*" send "\3"; continue

alright, build

expect "\r\n." send "compile @com1\r"; continue
expect "\r\n." send "compile @com2\r"; continue
expect "\r\n." send "r link\r"; continue
expect "\r\n*" send "@can1\r"; continue
expect "\r\n." send ""; continue
expect "\r\n." send "get decwar\r"; continue
expect "\r\n." send "ssave\r"; continue
expect "\r\n." send "k/f\r"; continue

if you don't do the send "" line you get a bizarre 'race condition' where the next line beats the '@can1\r' send to the linker - iterated on this many tens of times, it's real and it's weird - tried 'pauses', 'delays', 'sleeps', etc - only real workaround was to 'win the race' with 'nothing'!:0

now install. compuserve code is expecting directory [1,27] for keeping some global data, so create that now as part of install.

expect "\r\n." send -t after=1000k "login 1,2\r"; continue
expect "\r\n." send "r credir\r"; continue
expect "Create directory:" send "[1,27]/prot:777\r"; continue
expect "Create directory:" send "\3"; continue
expect "\r\n." send "copy sys:<055>=dskb:[10,7,DECWAR]*.exe\r"; continue
expect "\r\n." send "copy hlp:<055>=dskb:[10,7,DECWAR]*.hlp\r"; continue
expect "\r\n." send "k/f\r"; continue

# additional notes

there's more available we may end up using, beyond the above

noah@raspberrypi:~/tops703/tapes $ ./back10 -h
Usage: ./back10 [action] [options] [args]

Action is one of the following:

-c           -- create a backup tape containing the files in arglist.

-l           -- list files on tape.
-p           -- peek at tape data.
-s           -- show the structure of the tape.
-t           -- type file list as .DIR MTA0: does.
-x           -- extract files matching any of the args in arglist,
or any regexp given to a -R option.

Options are:

-b           -- build tree of output files.  (extract)
-d           -- omit device from output tree.  (extract)
-f <file>    -- operate on tape file for input/output.
"-" means stdin/stdout.
-h           -- print help text.
-i           -- interchange flag.
-n           -- number of items to print.  (peek)
-q           -- quiet (extract)
-v           -- increase verbose mode.

-A           -- set disk mode to ascii.
-B           -- set disk mode to binary.
-C           -- set disk mode to core-dump.
-D           -- turn on debugging.
-H           -- set disk mode to high-density.
-I           -- set disk mode to industri-standard.
-M <str>     -- set system name.  (write)
-O opt=val   -- set option to value.
-P <bits>    -- set/clear print control bits.  (peek)

format is raw, tap, e11 or tpc.
default is tap.
-U <str>     -- set device and UFD. (write)
format is "device:p,pn".

# utexas primordial tape reconstruction

there were seven key 'non include' code files. the high.for and low.for are stubs, and somewhat likewise for msg.mac and setmsg.mac.

DECWAR.FOR  FORTRAN source.
WARMAC.MAC  MACRO source.
SETUP.FOR   Once only code, deleted from core after initialization.
HIGH.FOR    Used to force common block into high segment.
LOW.FOR     Used to force common block into low segment.
MSG.MAC     Output text source.
SETMSG.MAC  Equivalent to MSG.MAC for SETUP text strings.

## teco scripts

six include files. five teco scripts in the tec folder originally were used to autogen five of the six.

lowseg.tec -> lowseg.for
hiseg.tec  -> hiseg.for
param.tec  -> param.for
extern.tec -> extern.for
setext.tec -> setext.for
lstvar.for, this is also an include file, but without teco autogen

probably the scripts simply search through warmac.mac and pick out 'variables' that need to appear in the include for files. this can be done manually. if there's an update to warmac.mac, include for files can be manually updated. the teco scripts probably just automate this, generating the include for 'from scratch'. so it's not a 'must have'. can be done by hand. but possibly nice. and an interesting usage of teco.

at utexas the build was done in [10,30,decwar] and then deployed to gam: which was a 'logical device name' assigned to [5,30]. 10,30 seems to have been the 'dist' account, which is 10,7 for many simh scripts. let's just accept that dist is [10,7] now, not [10,30]. this allows leaving many simh scripts as is.

# notes

v2.2 31 commands - bases, build, capture, damages, dock, energy, gripe, help, impulse, list, move, news, planets, points, quit, radio, repair, scan, set, shields, srscan, status, summary, targets, tell, time, torpedoes, tractor, type, users

v2.3 31 commands - apparently, zeroth order, same as v2.2

there was a 'micro script' l.mic used to drive the linker. micro is evidently something inbetween teco and macro? any case, it seems a bit obscure for today, but the following is clearly the crucial parts for linking, these are linker commands, entered at the r link * prompt

low/seg:low
high/seg:hi
decwar/seg:def
msg
warmac
sys:forlib/sea/seg:def
setup/seg:low
setmsg
sys:forlib/sea/seg:low
decwar/ssave
/g

this absolutely does work, after the little trick of first doing

decwar/save

then the remainder from low/seg:low
# starting point

with kermit rolling and files prepped over from raspi side to tops10 side, time this weekend to start digging into merlyn's instructions from the file 'changes' in the repo.

CAN1.CMD is linker control file for building executable.
DECCMP.CMD full compile control file.

these two @com1, @com2 are splitting up and equiv to @deccmp. @can1 gets used for r link.

.compile @com1
.compile @com2
.r link
*@can1
.get decwar
.ssave
then create p,pn [1,27] and install DECWAR.EXE, DECWAR.GRP, DECWAR.HLP, DECWAR.NWS in that p,pn. then
.dir [1,27]
.r [1,27] decwar

the one already there decwar in [1,27] is definitely working. and looks like there's also another older one already there in [5,30]

.dir [5,30]
.r [5,30] decwar

philbudne commented on Aug 22, 2018
F10/FORTRA (FORTRAN-10) was FORTRAN-IV (FORTRAN 66) until version 7,
which supported the FORTRAN-77 standard.  I seem to recall finding
version 1 of F10 in ITS' DECSYS directory.  I can't IMAGINE anyone
ever running v7 on ITS, and I wouldn't be shocked if it used TOP-10
monitor calls not supported by DECUUO.

current pic is that we're on dec fortran-10 v6 from 1981, which makes sense historically for decwar. this means a dec superset of fortran IV / f66. it meets the f66 ansi standard, and has dec extensions. we know for a fact that v5 did the same and already had the 'include' statement. highly likely that 'include' is one of the dec extensions to f66! here's a nutshell of current learnings for decwar context
dec fortran-10 v5, 1977, fortran iv / f66, plus dec extensions
dec fortran-10 v6, 1981, fortran iv / f66, plus dec extensions
dec fortran-10 v7, 1983, f77, ?plus dec extensions, !probly!?

# does decwar.com matter for compiling?

turns out, nope! this is a 'comments' file! com == comments. but understanding this did lead onwards to decwar.imp, where probably imp == important! decwar.com is additional comments, on top of decwar.imp and decwar.tap

# decwar.imp has mucho learnings about 'building decwar from tape'

this is clearly some important stuff. hence the '.imp' extension. and note it's first thing listed in decwar.tap file. in fact, decwar.imp and decwar.tap match up perfectly.

one useful thing could be that [10,30,DECWAR] was an important folder / sfd at some point, probably for the build from tape described in decwar.imp, so p,pn 10,30 and sfd [10,30,decwar] were important back then, and could still be! in fact it's even possible that if we were 10,30 and in [10,30,decwar] then everything would magically work. this may be something to try asap.

for our possible 'include' troubles, note especially

if it's not already there, create p,pn [1,27] using react, then copy DECWAR.EXE, DECWAR.GRP, DECWAR.HLP, DECWAR.NWS to its home folder to 'deploy/install' it. [1,27] is where decwar was deployed for compuserve. for utexas it was logical device name 'gam:', assigned to [5,30].
*.tap files seem to be binary images of original tapes, and amazingly it's still possible to use these directly. below is the log of supratim sanyal installing tops-10 on simh pdp-10 from tape *.tap files. copying this over from https://gist.github.com/tuklusan/8ef1d91b776580763698183af7266e57

Installation of TOPS-10 operating system fresh from tapes on SIMH PDP-10 using
latest SIMH 4.0 PDP-10 V4.0-0 (git commit id: 314a1da9). This is a screen session
log of executing the awesome procedure documented at:
http://www.asun.net/pdp10/downloads/t10inst.txt

# project utexas log

## 20251109 v1.0 on gitlab

## 20250814 gen2 robots

each robot plays d at first. if it lives long enough, it switches to o. this is incentive to stay alive to help win. next up can be an instinct to repair when damaged. beginning to experiment with a 'graphical galaxy' for 'watching' the robots.

as part of playing with using gitlab for decwar/utexas and decwar/galaxy did do a fresh setup on the raspi, which uncovered a few stealth speed bumps along the way. updated the main readme guide section with those, especially the summary paragraphs there.

## 20250719 'tell issue' fixed

came back after a few days with fresh eyes and spotted the problem. had already notice a crucial clue weeks ago but didn't understand it at first. strange 'tell messages' arriving with information about phaser and torpedo hits, blank lines, or occasionally even garbage. today noticed that with tell command bypassed these strange messages still arrive. this raised the question, could hit linked list entries be getting written into memory meant for the msg linked list? this is exactly what was happening. for the hit linked list, memory for ten ships was allocated, not for eighteen ships. the msg link list memory followed, and hit entries were getting written into it. simply needed to change the warmac line 'knhit==knhshp*^d10' to 'knhit==knhshp*^d18'. so now our outstanding topics are reduced to one - raspi pidp10 'temporary brain damage' - along with a note to keep in mind about locking unlocking.

## 20250713 'nice enough' workflow1

workflow1 has evolved enough to make public. nutshell -

- step1 and step2, hardware - once tops10 boot disk is created, it's stable and doesn't need recreation. possible gotcha is discussed below as raspi pidp-10 'temporary brain damage', but seems that simh, mongen, tops10, etc doesn't have any influence.
- step3 and step4, software - there's now a simh script boot-from-disk-fast.ini which goes directly to the tops10 prompt, without building decwar from tape, and can then run previous decwar build. the old boot-from-disk.ini is for initial decwar build or following builds.
- robot hordes - start-some-robots.sh is for quickly bringing up a game with many robots. the way to shut them all down at once is 'pkill -f python'. to watch the log of a robot use 'tail -f logxyz'. have a terminal running 'tail -f log1' to watch the output from 'superbot nomad' and see all the ships, including the romulan '??' when he's alive.

time to try moving onward to new topics, while continuing to improve the following old topics

- locking unlocking using tops10 enq deq uuo - for now, this's been simplified 'as much as possible'. it uses integer 'user codes'. user code 1 for calls from fortran. user code 2 for calls from macro. each decwar job has one lock at a time, and can call unlock anytime anywhere to insure it's released!
- tell command - there's work to do. if tell is bypassed, ten robots go indefinitely. with tell, they're usually fine for between one and three hours before eventually there's some trouble. currently some robots will get knocked out and can be restarted, the overall game goes on. there's not a total hard crash, more of a degradation. the problem has definitely been traced down below the fortran and into the msg que macro. the suspect code paths, with lower level funcs in parenthesis, are makmsg -> (rsrv, remv, updt) and getmsg -> (srch, remv).
- raspi pidp-10 'temporary brain damage' - what we're seeing is the raspi pidp-10 combo occasionally misbehaving, blinking oddly, etc, including failing to build tops10 or decwar. using dec10test to 'clear the blinkers' or 'pulling the plug' is needed whenever things get sideways. after 'sufficient reset' things are fine again. basically the raspi pidp-10 has some kind of 'memory' or 'state' around what's happened to it recently, and it gets sideways over time. fine. nuke it from orbit.

# intro

objective here is syncing .for and .mac files between 'simh decwar' and 'other machines'. lots of the below is a walkthrough of notes tracing back via drforbin to the ancestral 'steubentech disk images'. here's a copy of the [kermit specific notes](./misc/kermit.txt).

seems there was good discussion of all this back in early 2010s - roughly 2013? seeing several simh scripts similar to the following. have this one saved in boot2.simh - it's second experiment, and is targeting kermit. note, am starting console on 1026 so it doesn't clash with simh pidp-10 ka-10 for front panel.

set cons telnet=1026
set cpu tops10
set dz 8b
set tim y2k
set dz lines=32
att -am dz 2010 speed=*32,buffer=1024k
att rp0 dskb.dsk
att rp1 dskc.dsk
att rp2 dskd.dsk
att lp20 printer.out
set cpu idle
;set throttle 2M
boot rp

seems the important thing here is the 'att -am dz 2010'. this is a multi serial adapter dz10 listening over telnet to port 2010. this is where we want to use kermit. we've booted simh with this script and telnetted in, aiming to start kermit server on simh decwar and connect to it via port 2010 from a kermit client.

we've got a '.' prompt from the monitor.

# onboard the raspi

meanwhile, onboard the raspi. first get [latest kermit](https://www.kermitproject.org/ckdaily.html). here we see it as x.zip. make, run, and connect.

Type the escape character followed by C to get back,
or followed by ? to see other options.

for escaping back to the raspi with ctrl-\c, be sure your keyboard is really sending backslash! had to switch keyboard config to exactly the right one by trial and error.

we're ready from the raspi side! now prepare the tops10 side. we need to be able to login from the raspi side! turns out, do walk through first [using react to create default user template](https://www.quentin.org.uk/tops-10-faq/#qaef-176). doesn't take as long as it looks! then [create your account](https://www.quentin.org.uk/tops-10-faq/#qaef-177).

note, if it's not already there, create p,pn [1,27] using react, then copy DECWAR.EXE, DECWAR.GRP, DECWAR.HLP, DECWAR.NWS to its home folder to 'deploy/install' it. [1,27] is where decwar was deployed for compuserve. for utexas it was logical device name 'gam:', assigned to [5,30].

so probly better to create [1,27] usr decwar pwd decwar

did that here for [27,101] usr noah pwd noah and logged in from the raspi kermit side.

# onboard tops10

now can start kermit on tops10 side and send it over to raspi side. both 'r k10mit' and 'r kermit' seem to be same.

.r k10mit
TOPS-10 KERMIT version 3(136)
Kermit-10>set file byte-size 36-bit
Kermit-10>send test2.txt

can check it on raspi side

noah@raspberrypi:~/kermit $ cat test2.txt

on tops10 side go into 'server mode'

Kermit-10> server

escape back to raspi side with ctrl-\c. keyboard has to really be sending backslash! then can simply send files. especially, 'send *.*' from raspi decwar folder to copy them over to tops10 side.

# switching back and forth

on raspi side, we're in raspi kermit. enter 'c' to connect back to tops10.

on tops10 side, hit crtl-\c to 'disconnect back to raspi'

# fortran continuation line issue

seems the beginning line preceding a continuation line needs to end with a space character. examples from hiseg.for and lowseg.for

common /hiseg/
+	hfz, shpcon, shpdam, base, nbase, board, locpln, locr,

common /lowseg/
+	lfz, ntok, tknlst, vallst, typlst, ptrlst, who, iwhat,

if there's a space char right after '/' in the beginning line, they work. another example, from captur.for. need a space after Vloc,

if (.not. ldis(shpcon(who,KVPOS), shpcon(who,KHPOS), Vloc,
+	Hloc, 1))  goto 500			!adjacent to sector specified?

if the three examples above are fixed with spaces at the end of their beginning lines, then captur.for compiles ok.

ending space is stripped off by kermit, learned that for certain the hard way. if we could stop kermit from stripping off end spaces, it'd be huge. we've got 'properly fixed' files on raspi, just need to get them onto tops10 without 'unfixing'.

on raspi side need to set kermit to transfer mode manual and then file type binary

# fortran continuation line issue

seems the beginning line preceding a continuation line needs to end with a space character. examples from hiseg.for and lowseg.for

common /hiseg/
+	hfz, shpcon, shpdam, base, nbase, board, locpln, locr,

common /lowseg/
+	lfz, ntok, tknlst, vallst, typlst, ptrlst, who, iwhat,

if there's a space char right after '/' in the beginning line, they work. another example from captur.for needs a space after 'Vloc,'

if (.not. ldis(shpcon(who,KVPOS), shpcon(who,KHPOS), Vloc,
+	Hloc, 1))  goto 500			!adjacent to sector specified?

if the three examples above are fixed with spaces at the end of their beginning lines, then captur.for compiles ok.

ending space is stripped off by kermit, learned that for certain the hard way. if we could stop kermit from stripping off end spaces, it'd be huge. we've got 'properly fixed' files on raspi, just need to get them onto tops10 without 'unfixing by stripping'.

# kermit fix

got it! at last! this works, major celebration. on raspi side need to set kermit to transfer mode manual and then file type binary

C-Kermit>set transfer mode manual
C-Kermit>set file type binary
C-Kermit>send LOWSEG.FOR
C-Kermit>send HISEG.FOR
C-Kermit>send CAPTUR.FOR

on raspi side.

set transfer mode manual
set file type binary

on tops10 side.

set file byte-size 36-bit

and confirmed that git is not stripping the end spaces. can fix in the git repo, and now can kermit them to tops10.

# success

fixed all continuation beginning lines with an ending space character in git. used kermit properly to move them from raspi to tops10. successful build!
# telnet

can scan local network with android app 'fing' and see ip numbers.

Oh, by the way.  Whilst not being replicas in the physical sense, I have made software simulations of the VT100 and VT52 hardware that run the original ROM firmware/microcode.  There are some bugs, but the basics work.

https://github.com/larsbrinkhoff/terminal-simulator/

By the way again, there is a 1:3 scale VT100 replica with a working keyboard.  It's super cute!

hi lars, this reminds me - have wondered - is your terminal-simulator github project https://github.com/larsbrinkhoff/terminal-simulator/ what comes as part of the 'pidp-10 software package', as 'the vt52'? love that 'fuzzy glow' effect in that 'vt52 window', was pretty much the first thing wanted to see when got started with pidp-10:)

No, that's not my simulator.  The one that comes with the PiDP-10 was written by Angelo Papenhoff, which emulates the behaviour of a VT52 without modeling its internals.  Angelo has also written a Verilog simulation which does model the VT52 hardware very well.

we want to create a subdirectory called decwar and then 'change directories' so its our working directory. then we want to use kermit to copy the source files from raspi side over to tops10 side.

to create the subdirectory, use the credir command. at the start here, we're logged in our own user account [27,101], and we're in our own user directory [27,101]

.dir
TEST2	TXT     1  <057>   31-Aug-24	DSKB:	[27,101]

now we change directories using the setsrc command. it's documented in the operating system commands manual. 'cp' is for 'create a new default directory path'

.r setsrc
*cp [,,decwar]

.dir
%WLDDEM Directory is empty

and to change back to main directory

.r setsrc

get into our decwar folder and get kermit going there. put kermit into server mode.

Kermit-10> server

escape back to raspi side with ctrl-\c. keyboard has to really be sending backslash! then can simply send files. especially, 'send *.*' from raspi decwar folder to copy them over to tops10 side.

kermit seems to have skipped our 'docs folder' with 'send *.*', which is perfect! we don't want it copied over to tops10 side in any case! fine with us.

# permissions

once we got rolling with attempts to compile, it looked like there were permissions issues. to just bypass those, set permissions on decwar folder to <000>, and even then, started doing everything as user opr [1,2].

<a name="create-user">
how do i create a standard user?
</a>

first ensure that there is a default user template. see the faq for that. next run the user account management utility react and insert a new user ppn following the example below. you will need to be on the opr account to do this.

.r react
react>ins [27,101]
[readpl default profile loaded: [%,%]]
new user name: test
user>done
user [27,101] test inserted with password yebowupuc
a total of one user inserted
react>exit

now login to the new user account using login and the password generated above.

.login test
job 3 pdp10 tty0
password:
%lgnpcr a password change is required by the system administrator
new password:
verification:
[lgnphc password has been changed]
16:37 28-mar-118 wednesday
your user account is now ready for use.


<a name="account-template">
how do i create a default account template?
</a>

start the react utility and follow the recipe below. i have been choosy about access-types, you could just use all if you aren’t worried about how your system’s users can access the system and its resources:

.r react

react>exit

you should now have a default user who can login, is forced to change/set a password on first login, has access to the disk storage and can submit batch jobs. there are infinite quotas on the disk and the maximum core use is 512 pages. this is very generous, but unless you are intending on running a real timesharing service this will probably be the best options as it will put the lowest number of barriers in place for a user to do things.

<a name="mount-tape">
how do i mount a tape?
</a>

if you need to mount a tape from a operational tops10 system as a user, use a command similar to the following:

.mount tape:/reelid:label/nowait

the reeled: parameter specifies the tape label.

this will queue the tape mount request and the opr console will then need to action the request.

when using simh you will need to attach the tape file on the console and respond to the opr console.

14:44:01 -- magtape mount request #4 --
user: opr [1,2] job #2
volume-set name: tape

volume-id write labels track density

there is 1 request in the queue
opr>ide mta0: re 4
opr>
14:45:04 device mta0 -- volume bcpl reassigned --
user: opr [1,2] job #2

your tape should now be mounted on the system and accessible through tools such as backup.

<a name="user-accounts">
how do i manage user accounts?
</a>

as the opr you can manage user accounts with the react utility. this utility allows you to create, delete, and modify user accounts and their attributes. you would normally use this for creating a standard user account. before creating any standard user accounts it is a good idea to create a system wide user account template first so that any new accounts inherit some standard attributes such as the ability to login on a terminal. to execute react just type:

.r react
react>

the react> prompt is where you can enter into a dialog about user accounts. help works in this dialog.

<a name="restore-tape">
how do i restore a tape?
</a>

first mount the tape, see the faq on how to do this.

second use the backup utility to restore the files from tape. backup uses “/” as a prompt.

.r backup
/tape tape:
/rewind
/protection 155
/files
/restore dsk:=*.*

you will then get a list of files and directories being restored to your disk, at the end of which your will see the following to which you type ctrl-z to exit from backup:

"done
/^z
.dismount tape:
[mta0:bcpl read(c/h/s) = 2173280/0/0]
[mta0 dismounted]

you will now find the files in the directory you were using when you ran backup.

<a name="create-subdirectory">
how do i create a new subdirectory?
</a>

to create a new sfd (subdirectory) in your own ppn you use credir:

.r credir
create directory: [,,bcpl]
created dskb0:[27,100,bcpl].sfd/protection:775
create directory: ^z
.dir
hello bas 1 7-feb-18 dskb: [27,100]
bcpl sfd 1 28-mar-18
total of 2 blocks in 2 files on dskb: [27,100]

<a name="access-subdirectory">
how do i access a subdirectory?
</a>

you can either include the subdirectory in the command ppn argument or change your working directory to where you want to be.

to include the subdirectory in the command, simply append it after a comma in the ppn argument. eg:

.dir [,,mud]

to temporarily change your working directory for a series of actions, use setsrc as follows:

.r setsrc
*cp [,,bcpl]
*^z
exit

to return to your ppn just reference it with a ppn of [,] in any command.

<a name="bcl-device">
why is there no bcl: device on my system?
</a>

bcpl needs to have a bcl: ersatz device to function effectively. you can use the path command to set one up on a use by use basis, but the recommended solution in the bcpl documentation is to configure a permanent ersatz device in mongen. this is how you do it based on the tops10 configuration i am running. the key piece is the ersatz device line towards the end of the mongen program dialog:

.r mongen
write mongen.mic (yes,no) : n
mongen for 704 monitors

mongen will generate any known tops10 configuration. for information
about which configurations are supported, please refer to the spd.

.

this has now created a new system monitor in [10,7,mon] called sys2.exe which should now include the bcl: ersatz device. you will need to boot from this new system monitor and also create a ppn of [5,24] to be the directory for the bcl: ersatz device.

<a name="system-printer">
why won’t the tops10 system printer work?
</a>

assuming you are using simh to run your tops10 install on, you need to make sure the following lines are in your simh script or entered on the simh console before booting tops10.

att lp20 printer.out
set lp20 enable

all printer output will now go to a file called printer.out in the directory to start simh in.

next you need to make sure that tops10 has started the printer and the spooler. to do this ensure that system.cmd has the following:

set printer 0 page-limit 2000
start printer 0

you may not need to do the next step as the galaxy system should just start the spooler when it is need, but for completeness i did do this. in the sysjob.ini ensure the following lines are included:

lptspl
log

finally you need to ensure there is a forms descriptor for the printer in lpform.ini

.type sys:lpform.ini
normal/banner:1/header:1/trailer:1/width:136/lines:66/ram:lp96

this should allow output to be queued for printing and then appear in the printer.out file on the host.

i found that there may be an issue if you do not have a non-zero anf-10 node number and networking enabled. in this case the system does not appear to correctly assign the device to printer 0. in this case, you need to manually assign the device as follows in opr or amend the system.cmd to include the /device switch on the start printer command.

opr>shutdown printer 0
opr>
13:30:18 printer 0 -- shutdown --
opr>start printer 0/device:lpt0
opr>
13:30:41 printer 0 -- startup scheduled --
opr>

if you then send something to the printer it should just work. the more comprehensive fix to this is to setup anf-10 and give yourself a nod number greater than 0. the printer device identifier will then become lptn00 where n is the anf-10 node number, and this is supposed to fix the automatic start but i have not tested that. the simplest solution is just to put start printer 0/device:lpt0 in the system.cmd

# f66 vs f77

decwar is a fusion of fortran and assembly. roughly speaking, much of the real work happens in assembly, it's usually interacting with the high segment memory where the overall game state for multiple players/jobs lives. the fortran is somewhat of an i/o layer, interacting with the players. it's doing quite a bit of text i/o. now here's the thing. very roughly speaking the assembly code is 'six bit ascii' and expects the same with fortran, which means the f66 fortran66 ascii standard, hollerith characters, etc. f77 fortran77 ascii standard brought breaking changes with 'seven/eight bit ascii', character data type, suppression of hollerith, etc. here's the two relevant tapes for decwar.

tapes/BB-D480C-SB_FORTRAN10_V6.tap   f66  'six bit ascii'
tapes/BB-D480F-SB_FORTRAN10_V10.tap  f77  'seven/eight bit ascii'

we gotta care about that f66 tape. decwar is 'natively' f66. will discuss below 'porting' decwar to f77, it seems possible, but probly means breaking changes in the assembly code as well.

good question is which direction the 'math stuff' in docs/algebra and docs/inverse will go. f77 makes things 'easier' at least superficially... but does it make sense to 'stay old school' with f66, especially in light of 7090/7094, cdc, etc - in other words - for matrix inverse and simplex, fifties and sixties style - f66? or f77?:)

did indeed get decwar building and running on f10v10 f77 'ok-ish' - was actually playing with two players/jobs etc - but there's definitely i/o gremlins and looks like a major job to fix all that - to say the least:) set that aside in arc/utexas-f77 and focusing on f66 for now!

CHAPTER 1

SUMMARY



This document describes the procedures for  installing  the  following
software:


1.  Version 6(1144) of the FORTRAN compiler

2.  Version 6(2033) of FOROTS (the FORTRAN object-time system)

3.  Version 6(2033) of FORLIB (the FORTRAN library)

4.  Version 6(154) of FORDDT (the FORTRAN debugger)

FORTRAN, FORLIB, FOROTS, and FORDDT should be installed on  SYS:,  and
.HLP files should be installed on HLP:.

The release is in the form of a 1600  BPI  FORTRAN  distribution  tape
written in BACKUP interchange mode containing six savesets.

The distribution tape consists of the following savesets:

1.  <FORTRAN-DOCUMENTATION>

This saveset includes all FORTRAN  documentation  files.   It
also includes .HLP files.

2.  <FORTRAN-SYSTEM>

This saveset includes the .EXE and .REL files that should  be
installed on SYS:.

3.  <FORTRAN-TEST>

This saveset includes the UETP tests and .VER file.  It  also
includes  a  .CTL  file  that will run the same tests without
using UETP.

4.  <FORTRAN-OTS-DEBUGGER>

This saveset includes the sources for FOROTS and FORDDT,  and
all  intermediate  files  generated  when building FOROTS and
SUMMARY                                                       Page 1-2


FORDDT.

5.  <FORTRAN-COMPILER>

This saveset includes the sources for the compiler,  and  all
intermediate files generated when building the compiler.

6.  <FORTRAN-TOOLS>

This saveset  includes  the  miscellaneous  system  utilities
needed  to  build the compiler and FOROTS.  This includes the
BLIS10 compiler, HELPER, and other tools.













CHAPTER 2

INSTALLATION AND TESTING OF STANDARD FORTRAN




The following files comprise  the  FORTRAN  compiler  and  object-time
system.   Merely  copying  these  files  from  the  distribution  tape
provides a working FORTRAN system.  The FORTRAN software  works  on  a
KI10, KL10, or KS10 processor.  The files are:

FORTRA.HLP
FORTRA.EXE
FORTB.EXE
FORTC.EXE
FORTD.EXE
FORTE.EXE
FORTF.EXE
FORTG.EXE
FOROT6.EXE
FORLIB.REL
FORDDT.REL
FORDDT.HLP



2.1  INSTALLATION OF STANDARD FORTRAN
____________ __ ________ _______

Perform the following steps to install the FORTRAN system:

(1)  LOGIN as the operator.

(2)  Mount the FORTRAN distribution tape.

(3)  Use the CREDIR program to create directories for the contents  of
the  FORTRAN  distribution tape.  You may use directories of your
choice.  Type the following commands:

.R CREDIR
Create directory:dev:[proj,prog,DOC-directory]
Create directory:dev:[proj,prog,RUN-directory]
Create directory:dev:[proj,prog,TESTS-directory]
Create directory:dev:[proj,prog,FOROTS-directory]
Create directory:dev:[proj,prog,COMPILER-directory]
Create directory:dev:[proj,prog,TOOLS-directory]
INSTALLATION AND TESTING OF STANDARD FORTRAN                  Page 2-2


(4)  Use the BACKUP program to restore the files from the distribution
tape  to  disk.  If you wish not to restore a particular saveset,
just replace  the  particular  RESTORE  command  with  a  SKIP  1
command.  Type the following commands:

.R BACKUP
/TAPE MTAn:
/REWIND
/INTERCHANGE
/FILES                           !OPTIONAL
/DENSITY 1600
/RESTORE [DOC-directory]*.*=*.*       !SAVE SET 1
/RESTORE [RUN-directory]*.*=*.*       !SAVE SET 2
/RESTORE [TESTS-directory]*.*=*.*     !SAVE SET 3
/RESTORE [FOROTS-directory]*.*=*.*    !SAVE SET 4
/RESTORE [COMPILER-directory]*.*=*.*  !SAVE SET 5
/RESTORE [TOOLS-directory]*.*=*.*     !SAVE SET 6
/EXIT

(5)  Follow the "SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS" (if any)  at  the  end  of  the
cover  letter.   Also,  read the FORTRAN Beware file for any last
minute instructions.

(6)  It is recommended that you save the old  version  of  FORTRAN  in
case they are needed again.  Type the following commands:

.COPY OLD:=SYS:FOROTS.EXE
.COPY OLD:=SYS:FORLIB.REL
.COPY OLD:=SYS:FORTRA.EXE
.COPY OLD:=SYS:FORTB.EXE
.COPY OLD:=SYS:FORTC.EXE
.COPY OLD:=SYS:FORTD.EXE
.COPY OLD:=SYS:FORTE.EXE
.COPY OLD:=SYS:FORTF.EXE
.COPY OLD:=SYS:FORTG.EXE
.COPY OLD:=SYS:FORDDT.REL
.COPY OLD:=HLP:FORTRA.HLP
.COPY OLD:=HLP:FORDDT.HLP

(7)  Install the new FORTRAN system software by giving  the  following
commands:

.COPY SYS:*.*=[RUN-directory]*.*
.COPY HLP:*.*=[DOC-directory]*.HLP

Note that FOROTS and FORLIB have been built to  run  on  a  KI10,
KL10,  or  KS10  processor.   This  configuration is the only one
supported.  A slight  improvement  in  speed  and  space  can  be
obtained  on  a KL10 or KS10 with the following procedure.  First
remove the line:

ftki=-1

and insert the line:
INSTALLATION AND TESTING OF STANDARD FORTRAN                  Page 2-3


ftkl=-1

into file B10FRS.CTL, which creates F1SHR.MAC and F1REL.MAC.

(8)  Decide if you want to destroy the directories you created in step
(3).   For each directory you wish to destroy, give the following
commands.  (Note:  a directory cannot be deleted  unless  all  of
its subdirectories have been deleted.)

.DELETE [proj,prog,name-of-directory-to-destroy]*.*
.DELETE [proj,prog]name.SFD



2.2  TESTING OF STANDARD FORTRAN
_______ __ ________ _______

Perform the following procedures to test the FORTRAN system:

(1)  Install the FORTRAN UETP test  module  by  giving  the  following
commands:

.COPY UTP:=[TESTS-directory]*.FOR
.COPY UTP:=[TESTS-directory]FORTRA.VER

(2)  In the file UTP:UETP.DIR, add the line:

FORTRA.VER

Also make sure that the file UTP:FORTRA.SFD<777> exists.

(3)  If desired, run the standalone FORTRAN test  module  provided  by
giving the following command:

.SUBMIT F10TST.CTL

The test expects to find all the FORTRAN  system  components  and
the  distributed  FORTRAN  test  programs on logical device DSK:.
The test also copies certain required system software  components
to DSK:, for the duration of the test run.

When the test batch job is completed, the F10TST.LOG file must be
examined  to  make  sure  that  none of the tests branched to the
error label UERR::.

(4)  Once the FORTRAN system components have been  installed  in  SYS:
(see  Step 7 above), you may run the UETP test module provided by
giving the following commands:

.RUN UTP:UETP
UETP>ENABLE FORTRA/DEPTH:VERIFICATION
UETP>ENABLE
UETP>BEGIN
UETP>EXIT

If any errors occur, UETP will report them at your  terminal  and
INSTALLATION AND TESTING OF STANDARD FORTRAN                  Page 2-4


in  the  file  EXCEPT.LOG  in the UTP:  subdirectory FORTRA.  The
files FORTRA.LOG, RUN.LOG, and EXCEPT.LOG  may  be  deleted  from
that  subdirectory.   For  more information on UETP, see the UETP
Procedures/Reference Manual.

Run your own tests if desired.  If you run  your  own  tests,  be
sure that SYS:  is defined to include [RUN-directory].












CHAPTER 3

INSTALLATION AND BUILDING OF NONSTANDARD FORTRAN




This chapter describes building the FORTRAN compiler from  sources  if
modifications to the standard compiler are desired.  It also describes
building FOROTS, FORLIB, and FORDDT from sources.





3.1  BUILDING THE FORTRAN COMPILER FROM SOURCES
________ ___ _______ ________ ____ _______

Required software:

BLIS10 7E(227)
LINK 4A
MACRO 53A
SCAN 7B
WILD 7
HELPER 5(41)

Running the control file B10FTN.CTL will build the compiler  from  its
sources   and  produce  the  binary  files.   This  control  file  has
successfully built and loaded the compiler at  the  Digital  Equipment
Corporation  - Marlboro computer facilities.  This, however, in no way
guarantees its operation or support.

The control file used to build the compiler in-house  uses  a  private
pack  called  DSKP:,  and  references field-image software from ersatz
device  DEC:   ([10,7]).   BLIS10.EXE  7E(227)  is  included  on   the
distribution  tape.   One  source  file (COMMON.MAC) references [5,11]
(REL:) for several files.

Building the FORTRAN compiler from  the  sources  provided  is  not  a
trivial  computational  task.   It  requires  a considerable amount of
computer resources.  All of the modules will  compile  within  70K  of
user  core  with  the exception of LEXICA.BLI which requires 75K.  The
complete execution of B10FTN.CTL requires at least 2 and 1/2 hours  on
a  KL10  processor.   It  takes longer on a KI or KS processor.  It is
advised that  only  installations  desiring  to  modify  the  compiler
consider completely rebuilding it.
INSTALLATION AND BUILDING OF NONSTANDARD FORTRAN              Page 3-2


In addition, it should be noted that the supplied  control  files  are
divided  into  clearly  commented  sections  so  that it can easily be
determined which phases need to be reloaded if modifications are made.
Therefore,  installations  inserting  their own modifications into the
compiler usually need only recompile the modules  changed  and  reload
the  overlays  affected  without  rebuilding the entire compiler.  See
MODULE.MEM for a list of which modules are in which phases.


NOTE

When loading the programs LEFT72, LEFTFM
and  BUILD,  undefined  globals  will be
encountered.  These should  be  ignored,
as  indicated  by  comments  in the .CTL
file.



The control file called L10FTN.CTL will  produce  a  complete  set  of
source listings of the compiler.

To submit a control file to run on a KL10, use the following command:

.SUBMIT filename/RESTART/TIME:3:0:0/UNIQUE:0



3.1.1  Using The FORTRAN Compiler With DDT
_____ ___ _______ ________ ____ ___

The distribution tape contains a version  of  the  segmented  compiler
loaded  with  DDT  under  the  names  DORT*.EXE.   These files must be
renamed to FORT*.EXE before use.

If for some reason it is desired to load the compiler with DDT,  there
is  a  series of LINK indirect files included which are similar to the
*.CMD files used in B10FTN.CTL.  They are D*.CMD files and are used in
the same fashion as the *.CMD files.

Since only breakpoints in the low segment are phase  independent,  the
standard  technique  to  set  a  break point is to set one in FORTRA -
module MAIN at GETSG+53 and then SAVE the segment.  This will cause  a
break  point  to  occur at the beginning of each phase of the compiler
just after it is loaded.  At this point, break points can  be  set  in
the  particular  phase.   These  phase-dependent breakpoints should be
removed prior to bringing the next segment into core.



3.2  BUILDING A SINGLE-SEGMENT VERSION OF FORTRAN
________ _ ______________ _______ __ _______

The LINK indirect file ALL.CMD  (and  the  DDT  version  DALL.CMD)  is
included  on  the  distribution  tape  and  can  be  used  to  load  a
single-segment  version  of  the  compiler.   This   is   particularly
attractive  for  installations where the job mix contains many FORTRAN
INSTALLATION AND BUILDING OF NONSTANDARD FORTRAN              Page 3-3


compilations of several small  subroutines,  especially  if  they  are
handled   in   batch  mode.   Note  however  that  the  single-segment
configuration is not supported.

The single-segment version is comprised of the  same  modules  as  the
multisegment   version,   except   the  modules  DOPT.MAC,  DGCMN.MAC,
DNPT.MAC, ERROV?.BLI, and OWNDM.MAC are not needed, and ONESEG.REL  is
used  instead  of  MAIN.REL.   ONESEG  is  simply  a  recompilation of
MAIN.BLI, recompiled with the compilation control variable  FT1SEG  in
the  REQUIRED  file FT1SEG.REQ (built as FT1SEG.REQ in B10FTN.CTL) set
to  1  rather  than  0.   This  eliminates  the  GETSEGs.   Note  that
ONESEG.REL  as  well  as  SINGLE.EXE,  as  well  as  other modules are
included on the distribution tape.

If you wish to use the  single-segment  compiler  type  the  following
command:

.COPY SYS:FORTRA.EXE=SINGLE.EXE

FORTB.EXE, FORTC.EXE, and so on will no longer be used.



3.3  BUILDING FOROT6.EXE AND FORLIB.REL FROM SOURCES
________ __________ ___ __________ ____ _______

This section describes the  procedures  for  building  FOROT6.EXE  and
FORLIB.REL  from  sources  if modifications to the standard FOROTS and
FORLIB are desired.

The control file B10FRS.CTL can be used to  build  FOROTS  and  FORLIB
from  the  sources.   The  build  process  uses  structure  DSKP:  and
field-image software from ersatz device DEC:  ([10,7]).

This control file has successfully built and  loaded  the  FOROTS  and
FORLIB  at  the  Digital  Equipment  Corporation  -  Marlboro computer
facilities.  This, however, in no  way  guarantees  its  operation  or
support.

To run the control file use the following command:

.SUBMIT B10FRS.CTL/RESTART/TIME:0:30:00/UNIQUE:0


NOTE

The GALAXY  Version  2  QSRMAC.UNV  file
must be used to build FOROTS on TOPS-10.
A sample V2 QSRMAC.UNV  is  included  on
the  distribution  tape  in  the saveset
<FORTRAN-TOOLS>, but we  recommend  that
you  provide  your  own file to preserve
your  installation's   QUASAR   specific
parameters.
INSTALLATION AND BUILDING OF NONSTANDARD FORTRAN              Page 3-4


3.3.1  Using A Non-standard QUASAR Interface
_____ _ ____________ ______ _________

If your site has  modified  the  QUASAR  system  file  QSRMAC.MAC,  to
include  new  fields  in  the  "CREATE"  message for example, you must
rebuild FOROTS from sources.  If you have  added  non-standard  fields
that  should  not  be  left blank, you must modify FOROPN.MAC near the
label "CLSQ", otherwise FORTRAN programs will not be able to  use  the
DISPOSE='<queue>' options of the CLOSE statement.



3.3.2  Building A FOROT6 With Symbols
________ _ ______ ____ _______

FOROT6.EXE does not normally contain symbols.  This configuration  was
assumed  to  be the generally most desirable for TOPS-10 sites so that
memory can be conserved as much as possible.  However,  this  prevents
easy   debugging  or  patching  of  FOROT6.   To  build  symbols  into
FOROT6.EXE, you must edit the file  F10OTS.CCL  and  comment  out  the
first  line  containing  the /SET switches, and remove the ";" comment
character from the next line that contains the /SET switches.  This is
the  configuration  that  loads  symbols.   You  will notice that more
memory must be allocated (The PSECT origins are lower).

If the FOROTS you  are  building  contains  patches  or  is  otherwise
different  from  the  vanilla  released  FOROTS,  you  may encounter a
problem when FOROTS is rebuilt using this updated LINK  command  file.
The likely problems and their recovery procedures are:
1.  PSECT overlap - You must move F.CODE and/or F.ERR down;  LINK will
provide the information you need in the error message.
2.  Not enough room for symbols after  F.ERR  -  You  must  move  down
F.CODE and F.ERR origins.
3.  ?Page UUO error 4 - You must move up F.CODE and F.ERR origins.




3.4  BUILDING FORDDT FROM SOURCES
________ ______ ____ _______

This section describes the procedures for building FORDDT from sources
if modifications to the standard FORDDT are desired.

The control file B10FDT.CTL can be used to build FORDDT from  sources.
The  build process uses structure DSKP:  and field-image software from
ersatz device DEC:  ([10,7]).

This control file has successfully built and loaded the FORDDT at  the
Digital  Equipment  Corporation - Marlboro computer facilities.  This,
however, in no way guarantees its operation or support.

To run the control file use the following command:

.SUBMIT B10FDT.CTL/RESTART/TIME:0:30:00/UNIQUE:0

3.5  APPLYING SOURCE PATCHES TO THE FORTRAN PRODUCT
________ ______ _______ __ ___ _______ _______

Source patches (edits) are  published  in  the  DECsystem-10  Software
Dispatch  as  a problem description, accompanied by one or more FILCOM
files  which  detail  some  number  of  source  module  changes.   The
specified  problem  is  eliminated by insertion of the source changes,
and rebuilding  the  affected  FORTRAN  product  component  using  the
procedures described above.

In general, each edit to the product consists of a new  entry  in  the
revision  history comments, a change to the edit number of the product
component, and some number of changes to the code.  Code  changes  are
pinpointed by a line of commentary (banner line) that accompanies each
non contiguous set of source line changes.

The component revision histories and edit number definitions are found
in  REVHST.MAC  for  the compiler, FOROTS.MAC for the library and OTS,
and FORDDT.MAC for the debugger.  In  addition,  the  compiler  source
modules  all  have  a local edit number and revision history, found at
the beginning  of  each  source  module.   All  new  revision  history
comments  will  always  precede  the  line "***** End Revision History
*****".

Banner lines, which are provided only as a tool for  patch  insertion,
are  NOT  to  be added to the sources.  They are comment lines, taking
the forms:

!**;[nnnn] Where field 1, Where field 2, XXX, Date - for BLIS10 sources
or
;**;[nnnn] @ TAG + (or -) mL, Action, XXX, Date - for MACRO sources

Where field 1:  Routine, module, or macro name.

Where field 2:  @ line mmmm:    where mmmm is the line number
taken from a compiler listing
of the module. The word "line"
may not always appear.

@ text:         where text is used to describe
positioning when line numbers
are not available (such as
REQUIRE files).

TAG:            Closest unique MACRO tag to the source change.
May be qualified with feature test indicators.

mL:             The change goes at m Lines down (+) or up (-)
from the specified TAG. Using an editor to
position to the line defining the TAG, and
then advancing m lines will assure correct
positioning for the actual source change.

Action:         The usual 3 are: inserted x lines, deleted
x lines, or replaced x lines.
INSTALLATION AND BUILDING OF NONSTANDARD FORTRAN              Page 3-6


The BLIS10 line numbers referenced are those produced by compiling the
distributed version of the module, using the distributed REQUIRE files
(if any are required).  Distributed means exactly as  they  appear  on
the FORTRAN distribution tape, with no edits installed.

In situations where lines of  code  are  deleted,  a  single  line  of
commentary will be left behind containing the edit number that removed
the code.  This line MUST remain in the sources (just as banner  lines
must  NOT  appear).   Failure  to  adhere  to  these  rules  may cause
difficulties with later edits that give line counts from MACRO  module
TAGs used in previous edits.

Each changed line of source code (where  feasible),  will  be  flagged
with an edit indicator [nnnn] in commentary associated with the source
line.  For MACRO changes, this text will usually appear as  the  first
item in the comment field, such as:

MOVEI   T1,3            ;[1234] Get error count

For BLIS10 changes, this text will  generally  appear  down  the  left
margin of the source module, such as:

%[1234]%        T1 _ 3;         !Get error count
but may also appear as the first item in the comment field.












CHAPTER 4

BUILDING DBMS VERSION 5A WITH FORTRAN-10




This chapter describes how to build FORTRAN-10 with DBMS Version 5A.

First, install the accompanying LINK patches (see the  FORTRAN  Beware
file).   These  patches  enable  PSECTED  FOROTS and TWOSEG DBMS to be
combined  into  a  single  module.   This  version  of  LINK  is   not
recommended for any other use.

Make sure you have:
FOROTS.RLS
FORCNV.RLS
FORDBM.RLS
FOREND.RLS
FORERR.RLS
FORFMT.RLS
FORIO.RLS
FORMEM.RLS
FOROP.RLS
FOROPN.RLS
FORTRP.RLS
FORXIT.RLS
FORHAK.REL
and a non-DBMS FORLIB.REL in your build area.   Create  the  following
file, called 10500.FIX:

.EDIT 10500
.MODULE DBGATE
.INSERT OTSCALL+10,REPLACE,<PUSHJ P,DBMS.>
PUSHJ   P,DBMS%##
.ENDI
.ENDE

In the DBMS10.CTL file, at label QFORT, change the following .R MAKLIB
command sequence:

.R MAKLIB
*FORLIB=FORLIB/DELETE:FORDBM
*FORLIB=FORLIB,DBSFOR/APPEND,DBS10/APPEND,DBSANY/APPEND,SCHIO1/APPEND
*FORLIB=FORLIB/INDEX
BUILDING DBMS VERSION 5A WITH FORTRAN-10                                Page 4-2


to

.R MAKLIB
*DBSFOR=DBSFOR,10500/FIX
*FORLIB=DBSFOR,DBSANY/APP,DBS10/APP,SCHIO1/APP,FUNDEF/APP,FORLIB
/APP
*FORLIB=FORLIB/INDEX

Then change the following .R LINK command sequence:

.R LINK
*@DBSCS1F
.SAVE FDBOTS

to

.R LINK
*@F1DOTS
.RU FDBOTS
.SSAVE FDBOTS
When you are satisfied that the build has gone correctly,
rename FDBOTS.EXE to be FOROT6.EXE.












CHAPTER 5

BUILDING SORT VERSION 4C WITH FORTRAN-10



To install SORT Version 4C with FORTRAN-10, just restore the file FSORT.EXE from
the  SORT  distribution tape and place on SYS:.  The necessary interface routine
is built into FORLIB.REL.



[End of FORTRA.INS]


idea is to build on rich's work for scripted setup of a baseline tops10 for decwar

based on the steubentech image modified by merlyn that we have and that does work, we want scripted install from tape of fortran-10 v6 from https://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/ - here's download of tape image https://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/tapes/BB-D480C-SB_1981.tap.bz2

# itr1 - getr goin

ctrl-e in simh to get control

noah@raspberrypi:~/tops703 $ ./pdp10-kl load-decwar1.ini
noah@raspberrypi:~/tops703 $ ./pdp10-kl run-decwar1.ini

was trying the run.ini 'as is' and it ended like so

if "%SIM_NAME%" != "KL-10" goto KS
load -c bts/boot.exb
goto BOOT
:KS
boot %DSK%0
:BOOT

from rich - You can't boot directly to the RP06 on KL10. You need to load "bts/boot.exb", then continue to get it running, You get a BOOT prompt, pressing return will load and execute "dsk:system.exe[1,4].

below works! the 'continue' is the magic, and the script makes it all the way to logged in and tty stomper ready to get ctrl-c

if "%SIM_NAME%" != "KL-10" goto KS
load -c bts/boot.exb
continue
goto BOOT
:KS
boot %DSK%0
:BOOT

# itr2 - kl only cleanup, kermit, decwar account

first off, need kermit. can worry about fortan in itr3. with some good discussion with rich and merlyn, we're going with [1,27] username decwar pwd disabled. more notes about this below, under 'rando notes'. seems to be working good!

# itr3 - fortran and compiling

doing first compiles on scripted tops10 and will just share what am seeing - this is with the scripted fortran install from tape rich already has there in the library -

.R FORTRA
*^C
.VERSION
FORTRA 10(2530) +

we're just trying it to see - believe we're gonna need fortran-10 v6 scripted install from tape of fortran-10 v6 from https://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/ - tape image https://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/tapes/BB-D480C-SB_1981.tap.bz2

do have to suspect if we can install the fortran v6 tape, those two shooooooould work... now starting to really focus on that v6 tape image - https://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/tapes/BB-D480C-SB_1981.tap.bz2 and eventual 'do fort10v6.do' command and subscript to have right in here... comment out 'do fort10.do', uncomment 'do fort10v6.do'...?:)

;do fort10.do
do fort10v6.do
do kermit.do

got that tap file in among rich's collection now

noah@raspberrypi:~ $ cd tops703/tapes/
noah@raspberrypi:~/tops703/tapes $ ls -hl
...snip...
-rw-r--r-- 1 noah noah  11M Dec 23 09:07 BB-D480C-SB_FORTRAN10_V6.tap
-rw-rw-r-- 1 noah noah  19M Apr 16  2022 BB-D480F-SB_FORTRAN10_V10.tap
...snip...

beginning to learn about tap files - from zero - beginners brain! first of all, clone the repo for https://github.com/simh/simtools/blob/master/extracters/backup/backup.txt and compile a backup exe. copy that over to our tape folder, and then can do like so, should be some helpful info available in here...

noah@raspberrypi:~/tops703/tapes $ ./backup -tf BB-D480C-SB_1981_FORTRAN10_V6.tap
backup: opening BB-D480C-SB_1981_FORTRAN10_V6.tap for input
1  10doc.dir
2  forddt.doc
3  forddt.hlp
...etc...

ahha! but before very many hours digging into that tape - took a step back and thought 'even though it would be amazing if it worked, let's try the current fort10.do install script from rich, just replace the tap file name...' miraculously, it seems to somewhat work! at least didn't get lots of obvious errors during the install from tape.

took the fort10.do script from rich and simply changed the tap file name to point to the f10v6 tap - in a christmas miracle, this ran with very very few complaints - think there may have been one or a very few at the very end about copying/installing things - this may be relevant below

kermitted in the needed files and did the commands we've used in the past

.compile @com1
.compile @com2
.r link
*@can1

!!!the compiles all looked good!!!:) really started to think we got it! the linker died though

.R LINK
*@CAN1
%LNKFLE LOOKUP error (0) file was not found SYS:FORLIB.REL
[       Please retype the incorrect parts of the file specification]

guess right now is that slight glitch in the fort10.do script may not have copied that FORLIB.REL to the right place - could be if we get that FORLIB.REL going, we'll get it all! did that and with a bit of trial and error tinkering, got f10v6 going - committed the three key scripts in here https://github.com/drforbin/decwar/tree/minimalist/docs/tops703

# notes around getting f10v6 and decwar going

first off, strictly the facts, or as many as can remember from a very confusing day. got f10v6 going, tap file is specified here

expect "\r\n." send "r backup\r"; at %TAP%0 -r tapes/BB-D480C-SB_FORTRAN10_V6.tap;  continue

commented out second line here. evidently this mac file was not in v6 but was in v10. it was causing trouble before commenting out, for sure.

expect "\r\n*" send "FOROP.REL=FOROP.MAC\r"; continue
;expect "\r\n*" send "FOROPN.REL=FOROPN.MAC\r"; continue
expect "\r\n*" send "FOROTS.REL=FOROTS.MAC\r"; continue

and change the last lines to

expect "\r\n." send "copy sys:<055>=FORLIB.REL\r"; continue
expect "\r\n." send "copy sys:<055>=FORDDT.REL\r"; continue
expect "\r\n." send "copy sys:<055>=FORO10.EXE\r"; continue

they were written a bit differently before and this seems to have been why forlib.rel was not where it should be. in any case, this new way certainly does work for forlib.rel. there are apparently still troubles with foro10.exe, maybe it was not in v6 at all?

note '\xxx' is octal

expect "\r\n*" send "\003"; continue     ^c, ctrl-c, end of text, 'eom', 'etx'
expect "\r\n*" send "\3"; continue       ^c, ctrl-c, end of text, 'eom', 'etx'
expect "\r\n*" send "\032"; continue     ^z, ctrl-z, 'sub' substitute
expect "\r\n*" send "\32"; continue     ^z, ctrl-z, 'sub' substitute
expect "\r\n*" send "\033"; continue     ^[, escape

when creating the base system from tape via mongen etc, the first line below is important because it effectively kill some kind of disk process that hangs - this 'set cty stop' is useful, kind of the strongest medicine available within a simh script? one bizarre thing is the space before the ';' seemed to matter somehow. could have been confused about that. it also appears at the end, as in the second line.

expect "Disk Reads:" set cty stop ; continue
expect "\r\n." echo "Stopping"; set cty stop; continue

now for some 'softer' notes. the ordering of things, and building in delays via 'send -t after=100k' and 'send -t after=1000k'
seemed to have strangely powerful effects, especially when there were troubles, as in the f10v6 issues. even giving an odd sensation of async 'multi threaded' behaviour, which doesn't make any sense in the pdp10 context! this is why kermit install ended up before fortran install

do kermit.do
do decwar3-fort10v6.do

maybe 'out of order' output starts coming because of some kind of buffering, that gets overwhelmed when there's lots of messages? in any case, pauses at strategic points seems important! seems 'standard' for login commands, like this one

expect "\r\n." send -t after=1000k "login 10,7\r"; continue

# rando notes

here's some comments from merlyn

The original place where decwar was placed was 5,30 which was the GAM:
ersatz device, CIS was using [1,27] was the multiplayer decwar directory.
Everyone would be handed off from their original hosts to that HOST and logged onto that directory.
The CIS source is Always referencing it.

and another from merlyn 20241223

I could change it! But the cis code is looking for the stat (history) files in 1,27.
The standard utexas code does run fine in sys: [1,4].
If you guys can find the original ut code I'd love to look at it.
I think the reference to 1,27 is in warmac.mac...look there.

You dont have to login as 1,27
it just looks for the stat files in 1,27
The executable should be able to be placed elsewhere as well, I think?
Have a look at warmac.mac and search for 1,27
There should be a function called stat or something like that which is called to handle the history files.
The swap file of course follows whereever the executable is. You would have to change decfix.exe
because it does look in 1,27 also.

seems, at utexas the build was done in [10,30,decwar] and then deployed to gam: which was a 'logical device name' assigned to [5,30].

at compuserve, the build was deployed to [1,27]. not clear yet where they did there build, hopefully doesn't really matter too much?

note to self, if it's not already there, create p,pn [1,27] using react, then copy DECWAR.EXE, DECWAR.GRP, DECWAR.HLP, DECWAR.NWS to its home folder to 'deploy/install' it. [1,27] is where decwar was deployed for compuserve. for utexas it was logical device name 'gam:', assigned to [5,30].

## decwar.imp has mucho learnings about 'building decwar from tape'

this is clearly some important stuff. hence the '.imp' extension. and note it's first thing listed in decwar.tap file. in fact, decwar.imp and decwar.tap match up perfectly.

one useful thing could be that [10,30,DECWAR] was an important folder / sfd at some point, probably for the build from tape described in decwar.imp, so p,pn 10,30 and sfd [10,30,decwar] were important back then, and could still be! in fact it's even possible that if we were 10,30 and in [10,30,decwar] then everything would magically work. this may be something to try asap.

for our possible 'include' troubles, note especially

Files INCLUDEd in DECWAR.FOR (extracted from WARMAC.MAC by TECO macros):
PARAM.FOR	Parameters (constants).
HISEG.FOR	High segment common block.
LOWSEG.FOR	Low segment common block.

Tools used to build game (.SAV files generated from TECO macros):
PARAM.SAV	Build PARAM.FOR from WARMAC.MAC.
HISEG.SAV	Build HISEG.FOR from WARMAC.MAC.
LOWSEG.SAV	Build LOWSEG.FOR from WARMAC.MAC.
EXTERN.SAV	Build EXTERN.FOR from MSG.MAC.
SETEXT.SAV	Build SETEXT.FOR from SETMSG.MAC.

TECO macros used to build game (require TECO 124):
PARAM.TEC	Source for PARAM.SAV.
HISEG.TEC	Source for HISEG.SAV.
LOWSEG.TEC	Source for LOWSEG.SAV.
EXTERN.TEC	Source for EXTERN.SAV.
SETEXT.TEC	Source for SETEXT.SAV.

hmmm, don't have teco 124, potential trouble? wasn't for merlyn! but potentially could be for a 'build from tape'?

## merlyn's build workflow and the 'steubentech descendant'

with kermit rolling and files prepped over from raspi side to tops10 side, time this weekend to start digging into merlyn's instructions from the file 'changes' in the repo.

CAN1.CMD is linker control file for building executable.
DECCMP.CMD full compile control file.

these two @com1, @com2 are splitting up and equiv to @deccmp. @can1 gets used for r link.

.compile @com1
.compile @com2
.r link
*@can1
.get decwar
.ssave
then create p,pn [1,27] and install DECWAR.EXE, DECWAR.GRP, DECWAR.HLP, DECWAR.NWS in that p,pn. then
.dir [1,27]
.r [1,27] decwar

the one already there decwar in [1,27] is definitely working. and looks like there's also another older one already there in [5,30]

.dir [5,30]
.r [5,30] decwar
from bitsavers. simh decwars is 7.03

there are three disk image binary files and the objective is to boot into the tops-10 they contain. the following are simh commands to save in a text file beside the three binary files, for example boot.simh

set cons telnet=1025
at rp0 dskb.dsk
at rp1 dskc.dsk
at rp2 dskd.dsk
boot rp

we also want to use simh to build a pdp10 binary executable beside the four files above. what worked on a raspi5 was to clone the simh repo

go into the repo and make pdp10

then go into the build folder, have all five files there, and run the new pdp10 binary

from here on, things have 'gone internal' within tops-10 and the topics become tops-10 specific.

note, am starting console on 1026 so it doesn't clash with simh pidp-10 ka-10 for front panel.

set cons telnet=1026
set cpu tops10
set dz 8b
set tim y2k
set dz lines=32
att -am dz 2010 speed=*32,buffer=1024k
att rp0 dskb.dsk
att rp1 dskc.dsk
att rp2 dskd.dsk
att lp20 printer.out
set cpu idle
;set throttle 2M
boot rp

seems the important thing here is the 'att -am dz 2010'. this is a multi serial adapter dz10 listening over telnet to port 2010. this is where we want to use kermit. we've booted simh with this script and telnetted in, aiming to start kermit server on simh decwar and connect to it via port 2010 from a kermit client.

Have fun!
.LOGIN 1,2
.R OPSER
[OPRPAF Processing auto command file]

does auto login to [1,2] and runs opser. the login 1,2 is passwordless for console, not for non console telnet. 'tty stomper' starts, get out of it with ctrl-c. can logout of opser with 'kjob' or 'k/f' then login as another user, but might as well keep this free 1,2 login going.

we've got a '.' prompt from the monitor.

# later / follow-on notes

first got a copy of these disk images from merlyn. he's done awesome work on them, getting fortran and then decwar working. thank you merlyn!

as part of learning to use them, am gradually learning more about their heritage.

first steps down the rabbit hole was looking through the [joerg hoppe](https://retrocmp.com/impressum) [retrocmp.com website](https://retrocmp.com/), especially the section about [blinkenbone](https://retrocmp.com/projects/blinkenbone/simulated-panels). there, it was first dawning that the disk images could have been built on top of some from [steubentech](https://steubentech.com/~talon/pdp10/). screenshots of booting the steubentech disk images looked familiar!

# december 2024 notes from pidp10 google group

I found out that devices are named differently in the KS version.  Especially since the disk images I grabbed are RP06s.  So I had to first define RPA0 and RPA1 as RP06s. Then attach them properly.  But it seems the images I grabbed does not have the passwords to login to other accounts besides the default Console login.  So I am a bit stumped there.  Did you build 703 from the tape images? Or didyou find a different set of images.  I also was not seeing port 2020 being listened to.  So the attach for that had to change to DZ from DC.  I can now kind of login.  Not sure the proper start up for this version.  Setting switch 32 worked.  But trying to force it via the pdpcontrol I learned I had to input the 8 as I tried 10 and it got confused.  I will look at your boot file and see what's different.  Thanks.

Make sure you build PDP10 simulators with PIDP10=1 If you download the ZIP files for the OS you want to run, in
directory, "<simulator> load.ini"   You can copy the disk images to where ever you want. run.ini will run the images.
For 7.x the scripts automatically configure for Bob's PDP10, KL or KS 10. Accounts are same as other Tops 10 builds.
Note this is build from tape and not pregened disk image. It includes compilers etc. Rich

"I found out that devices are named differently in the KS version"

Yes, I found that out the hard way as well. The KS-10 version of the SIMH user guide also helped me (attached, in case you don't have it).

"Did you build 703 from the tape images?"

No. I found runnable disk images here: https://steubentech.com/~talon/pdp10/

I have since evolved a lot from that. I would be willing to share my disks, I think I might have room on my DropBox account. Let me know if you're interested.

I did try building from tape once and it failed miserably. I want to look at Rich C's resources at some point.

"But it seems the images I grabbed does not have the passwords to login to other accounts besides the default Console login."

Do any of these work?
[1,2]      FAILSA
[6,6]      MAINT
[7,7]      OPER
[10,*]     DIST
[100,100]  DEMO1
[100,101]  DEMO2

Also, on the steubentech images, there's a "public" account with no password. As in, when asking to log in just say
username public and either it doesn't ask for a password or just enter nothing as a password.

I have it working now.  It runs the KS code and blinks nicely.  I found the password for 1,2 buried in the
description text for those disk images (RP06s).  No, I have not tried an install from tape.  I'd rather not as I am
sure it would not go well.  Not sure what you mean by you've evolved from steubentech images.  It works.  Is it
perfect?  Who knows. It works for now.  Glad I can be running later TOPS-10, but did not want to give up the
blinkenlights.  But I did not have to, so all is well.  It's been 45 years since I worked on a real KA-10.  :)

Like I said, if you don't mind waiting for 20 to 30 minutes, my auto install scripts will build you a Tops 10 disk
images with all software installed and tested. The install is from tape. You will also have a log of how to install
everything. Also where possible, compilers and other additions are build from source.

I built 7.03 and 7.04 from Rich's scripts today. It's an easy process (Thanks, Rich!). The whole job is spread
across several scripts but they do seem to be relatively straightforward. It should not be a major issue to modify
them as needed.

Build jobs for all available versions of Tops10 are available on my web site. https://sky-visions.com/dec These
builds will install available compilers and additional tools.
