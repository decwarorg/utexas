nutshell history

- 1971, [original single player star trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(1971_video_game)), written in basic for ucal irvine sds sigma 7, mike mayfield. in 1971, mike mayfield, then in his final year of high school, frequented a computer lab at the university of california, irvine, while teaching himself how to program. the lab operated both a sds sigma 7 and a dec pdp10. the pdp10 hosted a version of the 1962 pdp1 spacewar. mayfield had gained illicit access to the sigma 7 at the lab and wanted to create his own version of the game for the system. spacewar required a vector graphics display, however, and the sigma 7 only had access to a non-graphical teletype model 33.
- 1972, rewrite of original, basic for hp 2000c at hp office near ucal irvine, mike mayfield
- 1973, ut trek, written in basic, grady hicks and jim korp at utexas
- 1974, ut fortran, aka [super star trek](https://gitlab.com/esr/super-star-trek), single player fortran on utexas cdc 6600, dave matuszek and paul reynolds
- mid 70s, war, fortran two player version written for utexas cdc 6600, author unknown, rewritten by robert schneider
- 1978, [decwar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decwar#Original_versions), assembly and fortran, eighteen player version written for utexas pdp10, bob hysick and jeff potter. version 1.0 of decwar was released in august 1978. the university would make copies available on tape for the nominal fee of $50, and it soon appeared on pdp10s around the world. the greatly updated 2.0 was released in july 1979, and another major version, 2.3, on 20 november 1981.

[utexas center for american history](https://briscoecenter.org/) catalog item [v2.2](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/1aa48343-09ab-4b3b-a9f2-e2e525074a4d) has files migrated from a decus magnetic tape, including a somewhat doubtful patched executable, but no source code. here's the instructions a utexas player saw [june 3, 1980 v2.2 utexas](hlp/DECWAR22.HLP). utexas decwar had eighteen playable ships. this is also definitely what players at the southwest texas state university computation center, san marcos texas, saw circa 1983 and 1984.

[utexas center for american history](https://briscoecenter.org/) catalog item [v2.3](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/7e2ccf50-e814-4bce-91d2-a7f6440eabe4) is source code ported circa 2011 by merlyn cousins from the compuserve decwar 2.3 source code to simh pdp10. harris newman received this code around 1995, as discussed elsewhere in this repo. it started as an original utexas 2.3 tape and had been modified by compuserve circa 1981 for commercial purposes. here's the instructions a compuserve player saw [november 20, 1981 v2.3 compuserve](hlp/DECWAR23CIS.HLP). compuserve decwar had ten playable ships.

# going backwards

there's been a playable decwar, but it's a little different than the primordial utexas version. project utexas is about reconstruction of the original, converging nearer and nearer towards the primordial code and effectively going backwards in time. if a copy of the original code is discovered, it will hopefully match closely with the utexas reconstruction.

meanwhile, it's a living time capsule of fifty year old hardware and software, completely open for explorations and experiments. it's a big, many layered, complex system, but given time and user feedback can hopefully converge towards modern standards of friendliness and usability. and it's standing on the shoulders of giants. here's some discussion around those giants, and what they mean for day-to-day life with project utexas. the four 'steps' referred to here are the step1, step2, step3, step4 of the [guide](#guide) below.

step1 and step2. hardware. the hardware aspects are thanks to richard cornwell, and a useful entrypoint is rich's [pdp10 hardware repo](https://github.com/rcornwell/pidp10), and more broadly rich's [main hardware repo](https://github.com/rcornwell/sims). rich is a member of the [opensimh steering group](https://opensimh.org/about/). project utexas hardware can be a complex topic, as there were multiple generations of dec10 (ka, ki, kl, ks) and a zoo of attached devices. in a nutshell, it's useful to gradually become familiar with the hardware aspects of utexas. for digital systems, fifty years mean nothing, and at least in a digital sense the hardware is very 'real' and 'physical'.

step3 and step4. software. tops10, fortran iv, and other necessary low-level system code comes as binary tape images via rich's [personal website](https://sky-visions.com/dec/tops10.shtml). the way to learn about using these is by example and experimentation. getting familiar with the system tapes is a first step to being able to modify the creation and usage of the project utexas tape 'tapes/utexas.tap'. with that capability in hand, the next step is to be able to use the utexas tape to on-the-fly compile, link, and install decwar itself. improving that know-how is reflected in improvements to the simh script [utexas.do](https://github.com/drforbin/decwar/blob/master/utexas/simh/utexas.do). 

to have on the radar. project utexas relates with the higher-level [pidp10 project](https://obsolescence.dev/pdp10). utexas was directly triggered and inspired by the release of the pidp10 in the summer of 2024. all of the work and good spirit of oscar, lars, and rich are further inspiration. ideally utexas can be fully integrated within the pidp10 'ecosystem'. there are good questions to tackle here, especially around interactions between ka and kl simh exes, and also the [pdpcontrol](https://github.com/rcornwell/pidp10/blob/master/bin/pdpcontrol.sh) bash script associated with the pidp10 package. these are simply question marks to keep on the radar and learn about along the way. one thing to keep in mind is that decwar requires fortran iv/66, an earlier fortran than the fortran10/v/77 commonly encountered these days. it's possible that fortran iv integration will play a major role in the future of utexas within the pidp10 context.
 
# guide

baseline situation is to be on a raspberry pi that is/can be used for the pidp10 stuff. pidp10 is not necessary, but simply assuming most decwar will be associated with pidp10 raspi. have a local clone of the utexas repo and be in its 'utexas folder', everything happens 'inside the utexas folder'. git tracking does not include some relatively large and static binary files that you need to bring in manually, these are downloaded as an archive and taken care of in step1.

concerning raspi pidp10 'temporary brain damage', what we're seeing is the raspi pidp10 combo occasionally misbehaving, blinking oddly, etc, including failing to build tops10 or decwar. using dec10test to 'clear the blinkers' or 'pulling the plug' is needed whenever things get sideways. after 'sufficient reset' things are fine again. basically the raspi pidp10 has some kind of 'memory' or 'state' around what's happened to it recently, and it gets sideways over time. fine. nuke it from orbit.

please remember not to skip step 3 'prep utexas23 reconstruction tape file' whenever you have new changes in the decwar code. notably, on your first run, the step1 archive gives you an obsolete 'stale' tape. step3 is how you bring in fresh game code.

## step1 have the contents of the downloadable archive in your utexas folder

the script msc/create-archive-project-utexas was used to create project-utexas-archive-20250506.tar.gz. download the archive by hitting this [archive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aLbaDcyIBG6pUwKbhw9UbuXFTfXkR1Cd/view?usp=sharing) and dearchive the contents and have them placed in your utexas folder
- dec10blinken simh exe that will drive console panel if you have one
- dec10 simh exe that is plain vanilla and does not drive console panel
- dec10test simh exe that is just for testing console front panel
- back10 exe that handles writing and listing tapes
- tapes folder with tape images
- bts folder with kl-10 boot loader exe needed by the simh scripts
    
## step2 prep tops10 boot disk

    ./dec10blinken simh/create-boot-disk-from-tape.ini
    
this is no big deal, can do it repeatedly and often, can treat the disk as replaceable/expendable. the simh ini script is a good resource for learning about tops10. the disk will appear as folder dsk. the script should leave you at tops10 monitor prompt. do kjob to log out, ctrl-e to get simh prompt, quit to leave simh.

## step3 prep utexas23 reconstruction tape file

    msc/create-tape-utexas23-reconstruction

this bash script will copy the decwar source code into tape file tapes/utexas23-reconstruction.tap and do a listing of the tape, showing the contents as confirmation.

## step4 boot tops10 from disk with auto install of utexas from tape

    ./dec10blinken simh/boot-from-disk.ini

have the line 'do utexas.do' uncommented in the ini file to install/reinstall utexas. simh 'expect' usage is not yet top-notch and there are some hacky workarounds. it should finish by setting permissions on decwar exe so its playable by all and assigning the gam: device. telnet in and run decwar

    $ telnet localhost 2030
    Trying ::1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.

you can use the above to telnet in from multiple terminals and start the game as several players on both sides, then try the radio, phasers, torpedoes, shields, etc.
